     * Called when the activity is first created.
     *
     * This function sets up the main content view of the activity. It checks if the [Intent]
     * that started the activity contains an extra with the key [composeKey].
     *  - If the extra is found, it looks up the corresponding `ComposeFunc` from the `cmap` list
     *  and renders that specific composable example. This allows the activity to display a
     *  single example when selected from the menu.
     *  - If no such extra is present (e.g., on the initial launch of the app), it displays
     *  the main menu defined by the [ComposableMenu], which lists all available examples.
     *
     * We start by calling [enableEdgeToEdge] to enable edge-to-edge display, then we call our
     * super's implementation of `onCreate`. We initialize our [Bundle] variable `extra` to the
     * [Bundle] stored in the [Intent.getExtras] of the [Intent] that launched us. We initialize
     * our [ComposeFunc] variable `cfunc` to `null`. If `extra` is not `null` we initialize our
     * [String] variable `composeName` to the value stored in `extra` with the key `composeKey`.
     * We then loop through our `cmap` list to find a matching [ComposeFunc] based on the
     * `composeName`. If a match is found, we set `cfunc` to that [ComposeFunc] and break out of
     * the loop. If no match is found, we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
     *
     * We initialize our [ComposeView] variable `com` to a new instance of [ComposeView] with the
     * context of `this` activity and set our content view to `com`. We call the
     * [ComposeView.setContent] method of `com` and in its `content` composable lambda argument we
     * compose a [Box] whose `modifier` argument is a [Modifier.safeDrawingPadding] to add padding
     * to accommodate the safe drawing insets (insets that include areas where content may be
     * covered by other drawn content. This includes all systemBars, displayCutout, and ime).
     * In the [BoxScope] `content` composable lambda argument of the [Box] we compose a [Surface]
     * whose `modifier` argument is a [Modifier.fillMaxSize] and whose `color` argument is a [Color]
     * with a hexadecimal value of `0xFFF0E7FC`. In the `content` composable lambda argument of the
     * [Surface] if our [ComposeFunc] variable `cfunc` is not `null` we log that we are running
     * `cfunc`, and call the [ComposeFunc.run] method of `cfunc`, and if it is `null` we compose a
     * [ComposableMenu] whose `map` argument is `cmap` and in whose `act` lambda argument we accept
     * the [ComposeFunc] passed the lambda in variable `act` and call the [launch] method with that
     * [ComposeFunc] as the `toRun` argument.

/**
 * A Composable function that displays a two-column menu of buttons.
 *
 * This function takes a list of [ComposeFunc] objects and arranges them into a grid-like
 * menu. Each item in the list becomes a button. The layout is structured as a [Column]
 * containing multiple [Row]s. Each [Row] contains up to two buttons, creating a two-column
 * effect. The buttons are spaced apart evenly within each row.
 *
 * When a button is clicked, the [act] lambda parameter is invoked with the corresponding
 * [ComposeFunc] object, allowing the caller to define the action to be taken, such as
 * launching a new screen or example.
 *
 * The text for the first button in a row displays the full name of the [ComposeFunc]. The text for
 * the second button in a row is shortened to display only the part of the name after the first
 * space, which helps in differentiating related examples (e.g., "DSL" vs. "JSON").
 *
 * Our root composable is a [Column] whose `modifier` argument is a [Modifier.fillMaxWidth] chained
 * to a [Modifier.padding] that adds 10.dp to `all` sides. In the [ColumnScope] `content` composable
 * lambda argument of the [Column] we loop over `i` between 0 and half the size of the `map` list
 * minus 1. Inside the loop we initialize [ComposeFunc] variable `cFunc1` to the entry at index
 * `i * 2` of the `map` list, and initialize [ComposeFunc] variable `cFunc2` to the entry at index
 * `i * 2 + 1` of the `map` list, if it exists otherwise `null`. Then we compose a [Row] whose
 * `modifier` argument is a [Modifier.fillMaxWidth] and whose `horizontalArrangement` argument is a
 * [Arrangement.SpaceBetween]. In the [RowScope] `content` composable lambda argument of the [Row]
 * we:
 *  1. Compose a [Button] whose `onClick` argument is a lambda that calls the `act` lambda with
 *  the value of [ComposeFunc] variable `cFunc1`. In the [RowScope] `content` composable lambda
 *  argument of the [Button] we compose a [Text] whose `text` argument is the [String] value of
 *  [ComposeFunc] variable `cFunc1` and whose `modifier` argument is a [Modifier.padding] that
 *  adds 2.dp to `all` sides
 *  2. If [ComposeFunc] variable `cFunc2` is not `null` we compose another [Button] whose `onClick`
 *  argument is a lambda that calls the `act` lambda with the value of [ComposeFunc] variable
 *  `cFunc2`. In the [RowScope] `content` composable lambda argument of the [Button] we initialize
 *  our [String] variable `s` to the [String] value of [ComposeFunc] variable `cFunc2` starting 1
 *  character after the first space character. Then we compose a [Text] whose `text` argument is
 *  `s` and whose `modifier` argument is a [Modifier.padding] that adds 2.dp to `all` sides.
 *
 * @param map A [List] of [ComposeFunc] objects, where each object represents a menu item.
 * Each item will be displayed as a button.
 * @param act A lambda function that will be executed when a button in the menu is clicked.
 * The lambda receives the [ComposeFunc] associated with the clicked button as its parameter.
