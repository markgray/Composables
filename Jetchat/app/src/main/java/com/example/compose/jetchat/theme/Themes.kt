/**
 * The [ColorScheme] used when the device is considered to be in "Dark Theme". The [Color]'s use are:
 *
 *  - `primary` The primary color is the color displayed most frequently across your appâ€™s screens
 *  and components, we use [Blue80] for our [darkColorScheme]
 *  - `onPrimary` Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the primary color, we use [Blue20]
 *  for our [darkColorScheme]
 *  - `primaryContainer` The preferred tonal color of containers, we use [Blue30] for our [darkColorScheme]
 *  - `onPrimaryContainer` The color (and state variants) that should be used for content on top of
 *  `primaryContainer`, we use [Blue90] for our [darkColorScheme].
 *  - `inversePrimary` Color to be used as a "primary" color in places where the inverse color scheme
 *  is needed, such as the button on a SnackBar, we use [Blue40]
 *  - `secondary` The secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish your product.
 *  Secondary colors are best for: Floating action buttons, Selection controls, like checkboxes and
 *  radio buttons, Highlighting selected text, Links and headlines, we use [DarkBlue80]
 *  - `onSecondary` Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the secondary color, we use [DarkBlue20].
 *  - `secondaryContainer` A tonal color to be used in containers, we use [DarkBlue30]
 *  - `onSecondaryContainer` The color (and state variants) that should be used for content on top
 *  of secondaryContainer, we use [DarkBlue90]
 *  - `tertiary` The tertiary color that can be used to balance primary and secondary colors, or
 *  bring heightened attention to an element such as an input field, we use [Yellow80]
 *  - `onTertiary` Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the tertiary color, we use [Yellow20]
 *  - `tertiaryContainer` A tonal color to be used in containers, we use [Yellow30]
 *  - `onTertiaryContainer` The color (and state variants) that should be used for content on top of
 *  tertiaryContainer, we use [Yellow90]
 *  - `error` The error color is used to indicate errors in components, such as invalid text in a text
 *  field, we use [Red80]
 *  - `onError` Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the error color, we use [Red20]
 *  - `errorContainer` The preferred tonal color of error containers, we use [Red30]
 *  - `onErrorContainer` The color (and state variants) that should be used for content on top of
 *  errorContainer, we use [Red90]
 *  - `background` The background color that appears behind scrollable content, we use [Grey10]
 *  - `onBackground` Color used for text and icons displayed on top of the background color, we use [Grey90]
 *  - `surface` The surface color that affect surfaces of components, such as cards, sheets, and menus,
 *  we use [Grey10]
 *  - `onSurface`  used for text and icons displayed on top of the surface color, we use [Grey80]
 *  - `inverseSurface` A color that contrasts sharply with surface. Useful for surfaces that sit on
 *  top of other surfaces with surface color, we use [Grey90]
 *  - `inverseOnSurface` A color that contrasts well with inverseSurface. Useful for content that
 *  sits on top of containers that are inverseSurface, we use [Grey20]
 *  - `surfaceVariant` Another option for a color with similar uses of surface, we use [BlueGrey30]
 *  - `onSurfaceVariant` The color (and state variants) that can be used for content on top of surface,
 *  we use [BlueGrey80].
 *  - `outline` Subtle color used for boundaries. Outline color role adds contrast for accessibility
 *  purposes, we use [BlueGrey60].
