    <string name="bio">Hi, my name is Aleks.
\n\nI love fish.
\n\nThe kind that is alive and swims around in an aquarium or river, or a lake, and definitely the ocean.
 Fun fact is that I have several aquariums and also a river.
\n\nI like eating fish, too. Raw fish. Grilled fish. Smoked fish. Poached fish - not so much.
 And sometimes I even go fishing.
 And even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
\n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large salmon with my hands.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own aquarium.
 You should ask someone else about fishing, though.\n

    <string name="more_bio1">When I was a child my family used to spend the month of August in the
 San Juan mountains of Colorado. Back then there was no limits on the number of trout you could
 catch and we would eat all the trout we could eat three meals a day. There is no meal better than
 fresh caught trout dipped in corn meal and fried over an open camp fire. My mother especially
 liked the fact that trout have no scales that needed to be removed, and the skin of the fried
 trout had to be one of the tastiest parts of the dish.\n

    <string name="more_bio2">Today they have only "catch and release"
 for trout in Colorado. What a sick idea, you torture the beast with a hook in his mouth and then
 release him. Where is the pleasure in that? On the plus side it probably makes the fish more
 challenging to catch as time goes on, though I have heard it said that fish have only a ten second
 memory so they might never learn a thing from the experience.</string>
