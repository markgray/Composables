 *  - `var nickNameSaved` is the current string to be displayed in the nickname [Text] when the user
 *  clicks the "Done" [Button].
 *  - `var showDoneButton` is a [Boolean] flag which controls whether the "DONE" [Button] is shown.
 *  If `false` the "DONE" [Button] is not composed into the UI thanks to the [HideOrShow] Composable
 *  which wraps it.
 *  - `var showEnterNickNameTextField` is a [Boolean] flag which controls whether the "What is your
 *  Nickname?" [OutlinedTextField] is shown. If `false` it is not composed into the UI thanks to the
 *  [HideOrShow] Composable which wraps it.
 *
 * The layout uses a [Column] whose `modifier` is our `modifier` argument and whose `horizontalAlignment`
 * is [Alignment.CenterHorizontally] to have its children centered horizontally. The top widget is a
 * [Text] displaying "Alecks Haecky" (the author of the original app?), followed by a [HideOrShow]
 * whose `show` argument is `showEnterNickNameTextField` and whose `content` is a [OutlinedTextField]
 * whose `value` is `nickNameEntry` and whose `onValueChange` is a lambda which sets `nickNameEntry`
 * to the new value entered. Its label is a [Text] displaying "What is your Nickname?". Note that
 * this [OutlinedTextField] is only composed into the UI if `showEnterNickNameTextField` is `true`.
 * This is followed by a [HideOrShow] whose `show` argument is `showDoneButton` and whose `content`
 * is a [DoneButton] with an `onClick` lambda which sets `nickNameSaved` to `nickNameEntry`. The
 * content of the [HideOrShow] then includes an `if` statement which when `nickNameSaved` is not
 * the empty string sets both `showDoneButton` and `showEnterNickNameTextField` to `false`. Note that
 * this [DoneButton] is only composed into the UI if `showDoneButton` is `true`.
