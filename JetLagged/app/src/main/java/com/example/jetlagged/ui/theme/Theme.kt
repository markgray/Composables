 *  screens and components, we use [Yellow].
 *  - [ColorScheme.secondary] The secondary color provides more ways to accent and distinguish your
 *  product. Secondary colors are best for: Floating action buttons, Selection controls, like
 *  checkboxes and radio buttons, Highlighting selected text, Links and headlines, we use [MintGreen].
 *  - [ColorScheme.tertiary] The tertiary color that can be used to balance primary and secondary
 *  colors, or bring heightened attention to an element such as an input field, we use [Coral].
 *  - [ColorScheme.secondaryContainer] A tonal color to be used in containers, we use [Yellow].
 *  - [ColorScheme.surface] The surface color that affect surfaces of components, such as cards,
 *  sheets, and menus, we use [White].
