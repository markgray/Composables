 *  - `amount` argument is just our [Float] parameter [amount]

/**
 * This Composable is used by [AccountRow] to display the information the [AccountsBody] Composable
 * and the [AccountsCard] Composable wants [AccountRow] to display about an [Account] and by [BillRow]
 * to display the information the [BillsBody] Composable and the [BillsCard] Composable wants [BillRow]
 * to display about a [Bill]. We start by initializing our [String] variable `val dollarSign` to the
 * [String] "â€“$ " if our [Boolean] parameter [negative] is `true` or to "$ " if it is `false` (the
 * [AccountRow] Composable calls us with `false` and the [BillRow] Composable calls us with `true`).
 * Then we initialize our [String] variable `val formattedAmount` to the value returned by our
 * [formatAmount] method when passed our [Float] parameter [amount].
 *
 * Our `content` consists of a [Row] followed by a [RallyDivider] which separates this [BaseRow] from
 * Composables that follow it on the screen ([RallyDivider] is just a [Divider] whose `thickness` is
 * 1.dp). The arguments of the [Row] are:
 *  - `modifier` is a [Modifier.height] that sets the preferred height of the content to be exactly
 *  68.dp with a [Modifier.clearAndSetSemantics] chained to it that sets the content description of
 *  the semantics node to a [String] constructed from our parameters [title], and [subtitle], and our
 *  variables `dollarSign` and `formattedAmount`.
 *  - `verticalAlignment` is [Alignment.CenterVertically] to have the [Row]'s children center their
 *  content about the center line of the [Row].
 *
 * Inside the `content` lambda of the [Row] we first initialize our [Typography] variable `val typography`
 * to the [MaterialTheme.typography] of our [RallyTheme] custom [MaterialTheme]. Then we compose a
 * [AccountIndicator] into our [Row] with its `color` argument our [Color] parameter [color], and its
 * `modifier` argument an empty, default, or starter [Modifier] that contains no elements. The
 * [AccountIndicator] Composable is just a 4.dp wide by 36.dp high [Spacer] whose background [Color]
 * is the `color` parameter of [AccountIndicator]. Next in our [Row] is a [Spacer] whose `modifier`
 * argument is a [Modifier.width] of 12.dp and this is followed by a [Column] which contains a [Text]
 * displaying our [title] parameter using the [TextStyle] specified for [Typography.body1] by our
 * [RallyTheme] custom [MaterialTheme] (`fontWeight` = [FontWeight.Normal], `fontSize` = 16.sp, and
 * `letterSpacing` = 0.1.em with the default `RobotoCondensed` [FontFamily] using the  [Font] whose
 * resource ID is [R.font.robotocondensed_regular]. Next in the [Column] is a [CompositionLocalProvider]
 * providing [ContentAlpha.medium] as the [LocalContentAlpha] to a [Text] that is wraps which displays
 * our [String] parameter [subtitle] using the [TextStyle] specified for [Typography.subtitle1] by our
 * [RallyTheme] custom [MaterialTheme] (`fontWeight` = [FontWeight.Light], `fontSize` = 14.sp,
 * `lineHeight` = 20.sp, `letterSpacing` = 3.sp with the default `RobotoCondensed` [FontFamily] using
 * the [Font] whose resource ID is [R.font.robotocondensed_light]. After the [Column] in the [Row]
 * is a [Spacer] whose `modifier` argument is a [RowScope] `Modifier.weight` of 1f which will cause
 * it to use all of the space that remains in the [Row]'s incoming horizontal constraints after its
 * siblings have been measured and placed. We follow the [Spacer] with an inner [Row] that is used
 * so that it can have the `horizontalArrangement` argument of [Arrangement.SpaceBetween] which will
 * place children such that they are spaced evenly across the main axis, without free space before
 * the first child or after the last child, and the `content` of this [Row] is a [Text] that displays
 * our `dollarSign` variable using the [TextStyle] specified for [Typography.h6] by our [RallyTheme]
 * custom [MaterialTheme] (`fontWeight` = [FontWeight.Normal], `fontSize` = 18.sp, `lineHeight` = 20.sp,
 * `fontFamily` = `EczarFontFamily`, `letterSpacing` = 3.sp using the [Font] whose resource ID is
 * [R.font.eczar_regular]), this is followed in the inner [Row] by a [Text] that displays our
 * `formattedAmount` variable using the same [TextStyle] with both [Text] having as their `modifier`
 * argument a [RowScope] `Modifier.align` of [Alignment.CenterVertically] which centers their `content`
 * about the centerline of the [Row]. This is followed in the outer [Row] by another [Spacer] that
 * is 16.dp wide, and at the end of the [Row] is a [CompositionLocalProvider] providing
 * [ContentAlpha.medium] as the [LocalContentAlpha] to an [Icon] that displays the [ImageVector]
 * that is drawn by [Icons.Filled.ChevronRight], with its `contentDescription` argument `null`, and
 * its `modifier` argument a [Modifier.padding] that adds 12.dp padding to the end of the [Icon],
 * with a [Modifier.size] chained to that which sets the size of the [Icon] to 24.dp
 *
 * Beneath the [Row] described above is a [RallyDivider] which is just a 1.dp `thickness` [Divider]
 * that visually separates this [BaseRow] from any Composables that follow it.
 *
 * @param color the [Color] to use for our [AccountIndicator], this is the [Account.color] property
 * of the [Account] we are displaying when we are called by [AccountRow], or the [Bill.color] property
 * of the [Bill] we are displaying when we are called by [BillRow].
