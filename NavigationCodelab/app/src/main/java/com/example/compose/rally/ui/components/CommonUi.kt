/**
 * A row representing the basic information of an [Account]. We just convert our parameters into the
 * type of arguments that the [BaseRow] Composable expects as its arguments and then call [BaseRow]
 * with them:
 *  - `modifier` is just our [Modifier] parameter `modifier`
 *  - `color` argument is just our [Color] parameter [color]
 *  - `title` argument is just our [String] parameter [name]
 *  - `subtitle` argument is created by concatenating the [String] whose resource ID is
 *  [R.string.account_redacted] and the [String] returned by the [DecimalFormat.format] method of
 *  our [AccountDecimalFormat] field when passed our [Int] parameter [number].
 *  - `amount` argument is just our [Float] parameter [amount]
 *  - `negative` argument is `false` (if it were `true` [BaseRow] would prepend a minus sign to its
 *  display of [amount], which is done when called by [BillRow].
 *
 * @param modifier a [Modifier] that our caller can use to modify our appearance and/or behavior.
 * We are called with a [Modifier.clickable] which causes our [BaseRow] to call a lambda with the
 * `name` argument to load the detail screen for the [Account] it displays when clicked.
 * @param name The title of this [AccountRow], it comes from the [Account.name] property of the
 * [Account] whose information we are displaying.
 * @param number the account number, it comes from the [Account.number] property of the [Account]
 * whose information we are displaying.
 * @param amount the amount of money in the [Account], it comes from the [Account.balance] property
 * of the [Account] whose information we are displaying.
 * @param color the [Color] that [BaseRow] should have its [AccountIndicator] Composable use to
 * differentiate this [Account] from the others, it comes from the [Account.color] property of the
 * [Account] whose information we are displaying.

/**
 * This Composable is used by [AccountRow] to display the information about an [Account] and by
 * [BillRow] to display the information about a [Bill]. We start by initializing our [String]
 * variable `val dollarSign` to the [String] "â€“$ " if our [Boolean] parameter [negative] is `true`
 * or to "$ " if it is `false` (the [AccountRow] Composable calls us with `false` and the [BillRow]
 * Composable calls us with `true`). Then we initialize our [String] variable `val formattedAmount`
 * to the value returned by our [formatAmount] method when passed our [Float] parameter [amount].
 *
 * Our `content` consists of a [Row] followed by a [RallyDivider] which separates this [BaseRow] from
 * Composables that follow it on the screen ([RallyDivider] is just a [Divider] whose `thickness` is
 * 1.dp). The arguments of the [Row] are:
 *  - `modifier` is a [Modifier.height] that sets the preferred height of the content to be exactly
 *  68.dp with a [Modifier.clearAndSetSemantics] chained to it that sets the content description of
 *  the semantics node to a [String] constructed from our parameters [title], and [subtitle], and our
 *  variables `dollarSign` and `formattedAmount`.
 *  - `verticalAlignment` is [Alignment.CenterVertically] to have the [Row]'s children center their
 *  content about the center line of the [Row].
 *
 * Inside the `content` lambda of the [Row] we first initialize our [Typography] variable
 * `val typography` to the [MaterialTheme.typography] of our [RallyTheme] custom [MaterialTheme].
 * Then we compose an [AccountIndicator] into our [Row] with its `color` argument our [Color]
 * parameter [color], and its `modifier` argument an empty, default, or starter [Modifier] that
 * contains no elements. The [AccountIndicator] Composable is just a 4.dp wide by 36.dp high [Spacer]
 * whose background [Color] is the `color` parameter of [AccountIndicator]. Next in our [Row] is a
 * [Spacer] whose `modifier` argument is a [Modifier.width] of 12.dp and this is followed by a
 * [Column] which contains a [Text] displaying our [title] parameter using the [TextStyle] specified
 * for [Typography.body1] by our [RallyTheme] custom [MaterialTheme] (`fontWeight` = [FontWeight.Normal],
 * `fontSize` = 16.sp, and `letterSpacing` = 0.1.em with the default `RobotoCondensed` [FontFamily]
 * using the  [Font] whose resource ID is [R.font.robotocondensed_regular]. Next in the [Column] is
 * a [CompositionLocalProvider] providing [ContentAlpha.medium] as the [LocalContentAlpha] to a
 * [Text] that is wraps which displays our [String] parameter [subtitle] using the [TextStyle]
 * specified for [Typography.subtitle1] by our [RallyTheme] custom [MaterialTheme] (`fontWeight` =
 * [FontWeight.Light], `fontSize` = 14.sp, `lineHeight` = 20.sp, `letterSpacing` = 3.sp with the
 * default `RobotoCondensed` [FontFamily] using the [Font] whose resource ID is
 * [R.font.robotocondensed_light]. After the [Column] in the [Row]
 * is a [Spacer] whose `modifier` argument is a [RowScope] `Modifier.weight` of 1f which will cause
 * it to use all of the space that remains in the [Row]'s incoming horizontal constraints after its
 * siblings have been measured and placed. We follow the [Spacer] with an inner [Row] that is used
 * so that it can have the `horizontalArrangement` argument of [Arrangement.SpaceBetween] which will
 * place children such that they are spaced evenly across the main axis, without free space before
 * the first child or after the last child, and the `content` of this [Row] is a [Text] that displays
 * our `dollarSign` variable using the [TextStyle] specified for [Typography.h6] by our [RallyTheme]
 * custom [MaterialTheme] (`fontWeight` = [FontWeight.Normal], `fontSize` = 18.sp, `lineHeight` =
 * 20.sp, `fontFamily` = `EczarFontFamily`, `letterSpacing` = 3.sp using the [Font] whose resource
 * ID is [R.font.eczar_regular]), this is followed in the inner [Row] by a [Text] that displays our
 * `formattedAmount` variable using the same [TextStyle] with both [Text] having as their `modifier`
 * argument a [RowScope] `Modifier.align` of [Alignment.CenterVertically] which centers their `content`
 * about the centerline of the [Row]. This is followed in the outer [Row] by another [Spacer] that
 * is 16.dp wide, and at the end of the [Row] is a [CompositionLocalProvider] providing
 * [ContentAlpha.medium] as the [LocalContentAlpha] to an [Icon] that displays the [ImageVector]
 * that is drawn by [Icons.Filled.ChevronRight], with its `contentDescription` argument `null`, and
 * its `modifier` argument a [Modifier.padding] that adds 12.dp padding to the end of the [Icon],
 * with a [Modifier.size] chained to that which sets the size of the [Icon] to 24.dp
 *
 * Beneath the [Row] described above is a [RallyDivider] which is just a 1.dp `thickness` [Divider]
 * that visually separates this [BaseRow] from any Composables that follow it.
 *
 * @param modifier a [Modifier] that our caller can use to modify our appearance and/or behavior. If
 * none is passed then the empty, default, or starter [Modifier] that contains no elements is used.
 * @param color the [Color] to use for our [AccountIndicator], this is the [Account.color] property
 * of the [Account] we are displaying when we are called by [AccountRow], or the [Bill.color] property
 * of the [Bill] we are displaying when we are called by [BillRow].
 * @param title either the [Account.name] field of an [Account] when we are used by [AccountRow] or
 * the [Bill.name] of a [Bill] when we are used by [BillRow].
 * @param subtitle either a [String] for displaying the [Account.number] of an [Account] when we are
 * used by [AccountRow] or a [String] for displaying the [Bill.due] due date of a [Bill] when we are
 * used by [BillRow].
 * @param amount either the [Account.balance] field of an [Account] when we are used by [AccountRow]
 * or the [Bill.amount] field of a [Bill] when we are used by [BillRow].
 * @param negative if `true` we prepend a minus sign when displaying our [amount] parameter, and if
 * `false` we do not. [AccountRow] passes us `false` when it uses us, and [BillRow] passes `true`.
