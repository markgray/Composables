/**
 * This is the main screen of our app. First we initialize and remember our [NavHostController]
 * variable `val navController` using the [rememberNavController] method, then we initialize our
 * [NavBackStackEntry] variable `val currentBackStack` by using the method
 * [NavHostController.currentBackStackEntryAsState] of `navController` (it gets the current
 * navigation back stack entry as a [MutableState]. When `navController` changes the back stack
 * due to a [NavHostController.navigate] or [NavHostController.popBackStack] this will trigger a
 * recompose and return the top entry on the back stack). We initialize our [NavDestination]
 * variable `val currentDestination` to the [NavBackStackEntry.destination] of `currentBackStack`,
 * and initialize our [RallyDestination] variable `val currentScreen` by searching the [List] of
 * [RallyDestination] field [rallyTabRowScreens] for a [RallyDestination] whose [RallyDestination.route]
 * is equal to the [NavDestination.route] of `currentDestination`, defaulting to [Overview]'s
 * [RallyDestination] if none is found.
 *
 * Our root Composable is a [Scaffold] whose `topBar` argument is a [RallyTabRow] constructed to
 * use [rallyTabRowScreens] as its `allScreens` argument, with its `onTabSelected` argument a
 * lambda which calls the [navigateSingleTopTo] extension method of `navController`, and the
 * `currentScreen` argument is our `currentScreen` variable (the currently selected [RallyTab]
 * in the [RallyTabRow], each [RallyTab] compares this value with the [RallyDestination] it is
 * associated with and modifies its appearance if they are equal). The `content` of the [Scaffold]
 * is a [RallyNavHost] whose `navController` argument is our [NavHostController] variable
 * `navController` and whose `modifier` argument is a [Modifier.padding] that uses the
 * [PaddingValues] passed the `content` lambda to pad the [RallyNavHost] on all sides with that
 * value.
