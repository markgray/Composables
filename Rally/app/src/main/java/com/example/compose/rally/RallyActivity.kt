 * and [rememberSaveable] our [MutableState] wrapped [RallyScreen] variable `var currentScreen` to
 * an initial value of [RallyScreen.Overview]. Then our root composable is a [Scaffold] whose `topBar`
 * argument is a [RallyTopAppBar] whose `allScreens` argument is `allScreens`, `onTabSelected`
 * argument is a lambda that captures the [RallyScreen] passed the lambda in variable `screen` then
 * sets [MutableState] wrapped [RallyScreen] variable `currentScreen` to the value of `screen`, and
 * whose `currentScreen` argument is `currentScreen`.
 *
 * In the `content` composable lambda argument we accept the [PaddingValues] passed the lambda in
 * variable `innerPadding` and compose a [Box] whose `modifier` argument is a [Modifier.padding]
 * that sets its padding to the value of `innerPadding`. In the [BoxScope] `content` composable
 * lambda argument of the [Box] we compose the [RallyScreen.ComposeBody] of `currentScreen` with its
 * `onScreenChange` argument set to a lambda that captures the [RallyScreen] passed the lambda in
 * variable `screen` then sets [MutableState] wrapped [RallyScreen] variable `currentScreen` to the
