/**
 * This Composable is called by the [MainScreen] Composable when the app is first starting up as a
 * "Splash Screen". It fills the screen with the drawable whose resource ID is [R.drawable.ic_crane_drawer]
 * (a stylized crane), delays for [SplashWaitTime] milliseconds (2,000) then calls its [onTimeout]
 * lambda parameter. The root Composable is a [Box] whose `modifier` argument adds [Modifier.fillMaxSize]
 * to our [Modifier] parameter [modifier] (causes it to fill the [Constraints.maxWidth] and
 * [Constraints.maxHeight] of the incoming measurement constraints) and its `contentAlignment` argument
 * is [Alignment.Center] (centers its contents in the center of the [Box]). We use the method
 * [rememberUpdatedState] to initialize and remember our lambda variable `val currentOnTimeout` to
 * the [onTimeout] parameter (this function remembers a `mutableStateOf` [onTimeout] and updates
 * the value of `currentOnTimeout` to the new Value of [onTimeout] on each recomposition of the
 * [rememberUpdatedState] call. [rememberUpdatedState] should be used when parameters or values
 * computed during composition are referenced by a long-lived lambda or object expression.
 * Recomposition will update the resulting State without recreating the long-lived lambda or object,
 * allowing that object to persist without cancelling and resubscribing, or relaunching a long-lived
 * operation that may be expensive or prohibitive to recreate and restart. This may be common when
 * working with [LaunchedEffect] for example). Next we use [LaunchedEffect] with a `key1` of `true`
 * (the constant `key1` prevents it from being relaunched) to launch its lambda `block` argument
 * into the composition's [CoroutineContext]. The coroutine will be cancelled when the [LaunchedEffect]
 * leaves the composition. The lambda block calls [delay] with [SplashWaitTime] as its `timeMillis`
 * argument to delay [SplashWaitTime] milliseconds (2000), then calls the `currentOnTimeout` lambda.
 * While that is running in the background we call the [Image] Composable to have it fill our [Box]
 * with the drawable whose resource ID is [R.drawable.ic_crane_drawer].
 *
 * @param modifier a [Modifier] instance that our caller can use to modify our appearance and/or
 * behavior. [MainScreen] does not pass us one so the, default, or starter [Modifier] that contains
 * no elements is used instead.
 * @param onTimeout a lambda we should call when our [SplashWaitTime] delay is over. [MainScreen]
 * passes us a lambda which sets its [Boolean] state variable `showLandingScreen` to `false` so that
 * the [CraneHome] Composable will be called instead of [LandingScreen] from then on.
